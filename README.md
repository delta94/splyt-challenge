# Splyt Challenge

The task is to create a single page Javascript application using React.
The page should feature a map. The map should show markers illustrating
the up-to-date locations of on-demand taxis in the area.
You can centre the map on the location of Splyt's office,
51.5049375,-0.0964509.
The page should also feature a UI slider, that enables you to change the
amount of drivers displayed on the map. The range should be 1-50.
